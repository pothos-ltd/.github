## We <3 Open Source

Open Source Software is the backbone of the digital world. Our philosophy is;

> *if one takeith, one must giveith*

In the spirit of Open Source, we endeavour to release as much OSS as we're able to. All of us here at Pothos are indebted to OSS and we need to ensure we give back.
